## What is Immich Kiosk?
Immich Kiosk is a lightweight slideshow for running on kiosk devices and browsers that uses [Immich][immich-github-url] as a data source.

## Requirements
- A reachable Immich server that is running version v1.127.0 or above.
- A browser from [this supported list](https://browserslist.dev/?q=PiAwLjIl) or higher.

## Key features
- Simple installation and updates via Docker.
- Lightweight, responsive frontend for smooth performance.
- Display random images from your Immich collection, or curate specific albums and people.
- Fully customizable appearance with flexible transitions.
- Add a live clock with adjustable formats.
- Define default settings for all devices through environment variables or YAML config files.
- Configure device-specific settings using URL parameters.

## Example 1
You have a two Raspberry Pi's. One hooked up to a LCD screen and the other you connect to your TV. You install a fullscreen browser OS or service on them (I use [DietPi][dietpi-url]).

You want the pi connected to the LCD screen to only show images from your recent holiday, which are stored in a album on Immich. It's an older pi so you want to disable CSS transitions, also we don't want to display the time of the image.

Using this URL `http://{URL}?album={ALBUM_ID}&transtion=none&show_time=false` would achieve what we want.

On the pi connected to the TV you want to display a random image from your library but only images of two specific people. We want the image to cover the whole screen (knowing some cropping will happen) and we want to use the fade transition.

Using this URL `http://{URL}?image_fit=cover&transition=fade&person=PERSON_1_ID&person=PERSON_2_ID` would achieve what we want.

## Example 2
Fanyang Meng created a digital picture frame using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and Kiosk. You can read the blog post about the process [here](https://fanyangmeng.blog/build-a-selfhosted-digital-frame/).

This example includes instructions on how to autoboot a Raspberry Pi directly into Immich Kiosk.


------

## Installation
There are two main ways to install Kiosk: **Docker** or **Binary**.

### Docker (recommended)

#### *Option 1: Add Kiosk to your exsiting Immich compose stack.*

  1. Add the [kiosk service](#docker-compose) to your Immich `docker-compose.yaml` file.

  Follow from *step 3* in *option 2* to create the `config.yaml` file.

#### *Option 2: Create a separate compose file for Kiosk.*

  1. Create a directory of your choice (e.g. ./immich-kiosk) to hold the `docker-compose.yaml` and config file.
     ```sh
     mkdir ./immich-kiosk
     cd ./immich-kiosk
     ```
  2. Download `docker-compose.yaml`.

     ```sh
     wget -O docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damongolding/immich-kiosk/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yaml
     ```

     Set `Lang` to a `language code` from [this list](/assets/locales.md))
     Set `TZ` to a `TZ identifier` from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List)

  3. Create the `config.yaml` file.

     > You may use [environment variables](#when-using-environment-variables) if preferred.

     Create config dir and download `config.yaml` file.

     ```sh
     mkdir ./config
     wget -O ./config/config.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damongolding/immich-kiosk/refs/heads/main/config.example.yaml
     ```

  4. Modify `config.yaml` file.

     Only the `immich_url` and `immich_api_key` are required fields.

  5. Start the container

      ```sh
       docker compose up -d
       ```

### Binary

> [!TIP]
> Use something like `systemd` to automate starting the Kiosk binary.

1. Download the binary file
   Vist [the latest release](https://github.com/damongolding/immich-kiosk/releases/latest) and scroll to the assets at the bottom of the release notes.
   Download the archive file that matches your machines architecture and unarchive.

2. Create config dir and download `config.yaml` file.

   ```sh
   mkdir ./config
   wget -O ./config/config.yaml url
   ```

3. Modify `config.yaml` file.

   Only the `immich_url` and `immich_api_key` are required fields.

4. Start Kiosk
   ```sh
   ./kiosk
   ```

------

## Docker Compose

> [!NOTE]
> You can use both a yaml file and environment variables but environment variables will overwrite settings from the yaml file
> Set `Lang` to a `language code` from [this list](/assets/locales.md))
> Set `TZ` to a `TZ identifier` from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List)

### When using a `config.yaml` config file
```yaml
services:
  immich-kiosk:
    image: ghcr.io/damongolding/immich-kiosk:latest
    container_name: immich-kiosk
    environment:
      LANG: "en_GB"
      TZ: "Europe/London"
    volumes:
      # Mount the directory with config.yaml inside
      - ./config:/config
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
```

### When using environment variables

> [!TIP]
> You do not need to specifiy all of these.
> If you want the default behaviour/value you can omit it from you compose file.

```

### When checking `config.yaml` into a repository

It is recommended to avoid checking-in any secrets.

  1. Create a `docker-compose.env` file.

     ```sh
     touch docker-compose.env
     ```

  2. Remove secrets from `config.yaml` (and `docker-compose.yaml`) - generally `immich_url` and `immich_api_key`.

  3. Include your secrets in `docker-compose.env`.

     ```sh
     KIOSK_IMMICH_API_KEY=SECRET_KEY
     KIOSK_IMMICH_URL=SECRET_URL
     ```

  4. Update `docker-compose.yaml` to include `env_file:`.

     ```yaml
     services:
       immich-kiosk:
         env_file:
           - docker-compose.env
     ```

  5. Add `docker-compose.env` to `.gitignore`.

------

## Android

Although Kiosk doesn't have its own dedicated mobile app, the ImmichFrame team has developed a native Android application that's compatible with Kiosk. The app offers two key advantages:

1. Better performance through a lightweight WebView implementation (compared to running in a full browser)
2. The ability to use Kiosk as your Android device's screensaver

To get started, visit the [ImmichFrame documentation](https://github.com/immichFrame/ImmichFrame/blob/main/Install_Client.md#android).
After installing the app, simply launch it and enter your Kiosk URL to begin using the service.

### Additional options
The below options are NOT configurable through URL params. In the `config.yaml` file they sit under `kiosk` (demo below and in example `config.yaml`)

```yaml
immich_url: "****"
immich_api_key: "****"
// all your other config options

// 👇 Additional options
kiosk:

## Changing settings via URL
You can configure settings for individual devices through the URL. This feature is particularly useful when you need different settings for different devices, especially if the only input option available is a URL, such as with kiosk devices.

Example:

`https://{URL}?refresh=120&background_blur=false&transition=none`

The above would set refresh to 120 seconds (2 minutes), turn off the background blurred image and remove all transitions for this device/browser.

------

## Multiple Users

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature can only be configured using a `config.yaml` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is not possible to mix assets from different accounts.
> The example below will not work.
> ```url
> http://{URL}?user=john&person=PERSON_ID&user=jane&person=PERSON_ID
> ```

> [!TIP]
> You can remove specific asset sources that were previously set in your `config.yaml` or environment variables by using `none` in the URL query parameters.
>
> Example:
> ```url
> https://{URL}?user=USER&person=none&album=none
> ```
>
> This will disable both the 'person' and 'album' asset sources.

Immich Kiosk supports multiple user API keys. Here's how to set it up:

1. Configure multiple users by adding their API keys to the `immich_users_api_keys` field in your `config.yaml`:
```yaml
immich_users_api_keys:
  john: "api_key_here"
  jane: "api_key_here"
```

2. Access a specific user's content by including the `user` parameter in the URL:
```
https://{URL}?user=john
```

> [!NOTE]
> If no user is specified in the URL, Immich Kiosk will default to using the global API key defined in `immich_api_key`.

## Albums

### Getting an albums ID from Immich
1. Open Immich's web interface and click on "Albums" in the left-hand navigation.
2. Click on the album you want the ID of.
3. The url will now look something like this `http://192.168.86.123:2283/albums/a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.
4. The album ID is everything after `albums/`, so in this example it would be `a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.

### How multiple albums work
When you specify multiple albums and/or people, Immich Kiosk creates a pool of all the requested person and album IDs.
For each image refresh, Kiosk randomly selects one ID from this pool and fetches an image associated with that album or person.

There are **three** ways you can set multiple albums:

> [!NOTE]
> These methods are applied in order of precedence. URL queries take the highest priority, followed by environment variables, and finally the config.yaml file.
> Each subsequent method overwrites the settings from the previous ones.

1. via config.yaml file
```yaml
album:
  - ALBUM_ID
  - ALBUM_ID
```

2. via ENV in your docker-compose file use a `,` to separate IDs
```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_ALBUM: "ALBUM_ID,ALBUM_ID,ALBUM_ID"
```

3. via url queries:

```url
http://{URL}?album=ALBUM_ID&album=ALBUM_ID&album=ALBUM_ID
```

### Special album keywords

#### ` all `
Will use all albums.
e.g. `http://{URL}?album=all`

#### ` shared `
Will use only shared albums.
e.g. `http://{URL}?album=shared`

####  ` favorites ` or ` favourites `
Will use only favourited assets.
e.g. `http://{URL}?album=favorites` or `http://{URL}?album=favourites`

------

## Album order

> [!NOTE]
> - When using multiple albums, the order of the albums is random.
> - When using splitview layouts:
>   - Kiosk will look for a second image with matching orientation
>   - The second image shown may not be the next sequential image
>   - Priority is given to finding images with the right aspect ratio for a balanced display

This controls the order in which the assets from the selected album(s) are displayed.

The options are:

### `random` (the default)
The assets are displayed in a random order.

### `newest`, `descending` or `desc`
The newest assets are displayed first.

### `oldest`, `ascending` or `asc`
The oldest assets are displayed first.

1. via config.yaml file
```yaml
album_order: random
```

2. via ENV in your docker-compose file
```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_ALBUM_ORDER: random
```

3. via url queries:
```url
http://{URL}?album_order=random
```

## Experimental Album Video Support

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is experimental and currently only supports album videos with certain limitations:
> - Videos will autoplay with audio muted
> - the `experimental_album_video` [configuration](#configuration) setting must be enabled
> - the `prefetch` [configuration](#configuration) setting must be enabled
> - Browser codec support may vary

### Video Optimization Recommendations

For optimal playback performance, it's strongly recommended to transcode your videos. This can be configured in Immich:
```
Admin Panel -> System Settings -> Video Transcoding
```

**Recommended Settings:**
- Codec: H264 (for maximum browser compatibility)
- Target Resolution: Select the lowest acceptable resolution for your needs

### How Video Playback Works

1. **Video Selection Process:**
   - When Kiosk selects a video from an album, it first checks if the video is cached.
   - Videos are temporarily stored in the operating system's temp directory.
   - If not cached, the video downloads in the background while another asset is displayed.

2. **Cache Management:**
   - Downloaded videos are queued for display once ready.
   - Cached videos are automatically removed after 10 minutes of inactivity to conserve disk space.
   - Videos are automatically removed when Kiosk shuts down.

3. **Playback Handling:**
   Kiosk will skip to the next asset if any of these conditions occur:
   - Video codec is unsupported by the browser
   - Playback doesn't start within 5 seconds
   - Video playback completes
   - Any playback errors are detected

1. via config.yaml file
```yaml
experimental_album_video: true
```

2. via ENV in your docker-compose file
```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_EXPERIMENTAL_ALBUM_VIDEO: true
```

3. via url queries:
```url
http://{URL}?experimental_album_video=true
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your videos are transcoded to H264 format.
- Check browser compatibility with your video codecs.
- Verify that `prefetch` is enabled in your configuration.
- Monitor system storage for cached video files.

## Exclude albums

This feature allows you to prevent specific album assets from being displayed in the slideshow.

> [!NOTE]
> Excluded albums take precedence over album selection methods. If an album is in both the selected albums and excluded albums lists, it will be excluded.

> [!TIP]
> You can remove excluded albums that were previously set in your `config.yaml` or environment variables by using `none` in the URL query parameters.
>
> Example:
> ```url
> https://{URL}?album=ALBUM_ID&exclude_album=none
> ```

### Getting an albums ID from Immich
1. Open Immich's web interface and click on "Albums" in the left-hand navigation.
2. Click on the album you want the ID of.
3. The url will now look something like this `http://192.168.86.123:2283/albums/a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.
4. The album ID is everything after `albums/`, so in this example it would be `a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.


There are **three** ways you can exclude albums:

> [!NOTE]

> Each subsequent method overwrites the settings from the previous ones.

1. via config.yaml file
```yaml
excluded_albums:
  - ALBUM_ID
  - ALBUM_ID
```

2. via ENV in your docker-compose file use a `,` to separate IDs
```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_EXCLUDED_ALBUMS: "ALBUM_ID,ALBUM_ID,ALBUM_ID"
```

3. via url queries:

> [!NOTE]
> it is `exclude_album=` and not `excluded_albums=`

```url
http://{URL}?exclude_album=ALBUM_ID&exclude_album=ALBUM_ID&exclude_album=ALBUM_ID
```

------

### People

### Getting a person's ID from Immich
1. Open Immich's web interface and click on "Explore" in the left-hand navigation.
2. Click on the person you want the ID of (you may have to click "view all" if you don't see them).
3. The url will now look something like this `http://192.168.86.123:2283/people/a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.
4. The persons ID is everything after `people/`, so in this example it would be `a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.

### How multiple people work
When you specify multiple people and/or albums, Immich Kiosk creates a pool of all the requested album and person IDs.

> [!NOTE]
> These methods are applied in order of precedence. URL queries take the highest priority, followed by environment variables, and finally the config.yaml file.
> Each subsequent method overwrites the settings from the previous ones.

1. via config.yaml file

```

2. via ENV in your docker-compose file use a `,` to separate IDs

```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_PERSON: "PERSON_ID,PERSON_ID,PERSON_ID"
```

3. via url queries

```url
http://{URL}?person=PERSON_ID&person=PERSON_ID&person=PERSON_ID
```

### Special people keywords

#### ` all `
Will use all named people.
e.g. `http://{URL}?person=all`

## Exclude people

> [!NOTE]
> The person or people you want to exclude from the slideshow must be tagged for the exclusion to work.

This feature allows you to prevent specific people from being displayed in the slideshow.

> [!TIP]

3. The url will now look something like this `http://192.168.86.123:2283/people/a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.
4. The persons ID is everything after `people/`, so in this example it would be `a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.


There are **three** ways you can exclude people:

> [!NOTE]
> These methods are applied in order of precedence. URL queries take the highest priority, followed by environment variables, and finally the config.yaml file.
> Each subsequent method overwrites the settings from the previous ones.

1. via config.yaml file
```yaml
excluded_people:
  - PERSON_ID
  - PERSON_ID
```

2. via ENV in your docker-compose file use a `,` to separate IDs
```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_EXCLUDED_PEOPLE: "PERSON_ID,PERSON_ID,PERSON_ID"
```

3. via url queries:

> [!NOTE]
> it is `exclude_person=` and not `excluded_people=`

```url
http://{URL}?exclude_person=PERSON_ID&exclude_person=PERSON_ID&exclude_person=PERSON_ID
```

------

### Date range

> [!TIP]
> You can use `today` as an alias for the current date.
> Examples:
> `http://{URL}?date=today`
> `http://{URL}?date=2023-01-01_to_today`

### How date ranges work as asset buckets
Date ranges in Immich Kiosk create distinct pools (or "buckets") of assets based on their timestamps.
Unlike filters that modify existing collections, each date range defines its own independent set of assets.
When you specify multiple date ranges, Kiosk maintains separate buckets for each range and randomly selects
one bucket during image refresh to fetch an asset from.

### Allowed formats
- `YYYY-MM-DD_to_YYYY-MM-DD` e.g.2023-01-01_to_2023-02-01
- `last-XX-days` e.g. last-30-days

There are **three** ways you can set date ranges:

> [!NOTE]
> These methods are applied in order of precedence. URL queries take the highest priority, followed by environment variables, and finally the config.yaml file.
> Each subsequent method overwrites the settings from the previous ones.

1. via config.yaml file

```yaml
date:
  - 2023-01-01_to_2023-02-01
  - 2024-11-12_to_2023-11-18
  - last-30-days
  - today
```

2. via ENV in your docker-compose file use a `,` to separate IDs

```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_DATE: "DATE_RANGE,DATE_RANGE,DATE_RANGE"
```

3. via url queries

```url
http://{URL}?date=DATE_RANGE&date=DATE_RANGE&date=DATE_RANGE
```

------

## Tags

### Getting a tag value from Immich
1. Open Immich's web interface and click on "Tags" in the left-hand navigation.
2. Click on the tag you want the value of.
3. The url will now look something like this `http://192.168.86.123:2283/tags?path=cake`.
4. The tag value is everything after `path=`, so in this example it would be `cake`.

### How multiple tags work
When you specify multiple tags, Immich Kiosk creates a pool of all the requested tag values.
For each asset refresh, Kiosk randomly selects one of the tag values from this pool and fetches an asset associated with it.

There are **three** ways you can set multiple tags:

> [!NOTE]
> These methods are applied in order of precedence. URL queries take the highest priority, followed by environment variables, and finally the config.yaml file.
> Each subsequent method overwrites the settings from the previous ones.

1. via config.yaml file
```yaml
tag:
  - TAG_VALUE
  - TAG_VALUE
```

2. via ENV in your docker-compose file use a `,` to separate IDs
```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_TAG: "TAG_VALUE,TAG_VALUE,TAG_VALUE"
```

3. via url queries:

```url
http://{URL}?tag=TAG_VALUE&tag=TAG_VALUE&tag=TAG_VALUE
```


------

## Filters

> [!NOTE]
> Not all filters work on all asset source/buckets.

Filters allow you to filter asset buckets (people/albums/date etc.) by certain criteria.

### Date filter

> [!NOTE]
> `date_filter` applies to person, album, tag and random assets.

`date_filter` accepts the same values as [date range](#date-range).

examples:
`http://{URL}?person=PERSON_ID&date_filter=2023-01-01_to_2023-02-01` will only show assets of the supplied person between 2023-01-01 and 2023-02-01.

`http://{URL}?date_filter=last-30-days` will only show (random) assets from the last 30 days.

------

## Image fit

This controls how the image will fit on your screen.
The options are:

### Contain (the default)
The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit the whole screen. If the image is smaller than your screen, there will be some fuzzyness to your image.

### Cover
The image will cover the whole screen. To achieve this the image will mostly likely have some clipping/cropping and if the image is smaller than your screen, there will be some fuzzyness to your image.

### None
The image is centered and displayed "as is". If the image is larger than your screen it will be scaled down to fit your screen.

------

## Image effects

### zoom
> [!NOTE]
> [Image fit](#image-fit) is set to `cover` automatically when this effect is used, unless layout is set to `single`.

This effect zooms in or out to add movement to your images, with the center of the image as the focal point.

### smart-zoom
> [!NOTE]
> [Image fit](#image-fit) is set to `cover` automatically when this effect is used.
> If the image has multiple faces, Kiosk calculates the center of all faces to use as the focal point.

Smart zoom works like the regular zoom but focuses on faces and includes both zooming and panning.

> [!TIP]
> To achieve a "Ken Burns" style effect change the `image_effect_amount` to somewhere between 200-400.

------

## Date format
> [!NOTE]
> Some characters, such as `/` and `:` are not allowed in URL params.
> So while you can set the date layout via URL params, I would suggest setting them via `config.yaml` or environment variables.


You can use the below values to create your preferred date layout.

| **Value**   | **Example output**  |
|-------------|--------------|
| YYYY        | 2024         |
| YY          | 24           |
| MMMM        | August       |
| MMM         | Aug          |
| MM          | 08           |
| M           | 8            |
| DDDD        | Monday       |
| DDD         | Mon          |
| DD          | 04           |
| D           | 4            |

### Date layout examples
These examples assume that today's date is the 22nd of August 2024.

* "YYYY-MM-DD"        => "2024-08-22"
* "YYYY/MM/DD"        => "2024/08/22"
* "YYYY:MM:DD"        => "2024:08:22"
* "YYYY MM DD"        => "2024 08 22"
* "YYYY MMM (DDD)"    => "2024 Aug (Thur)"
* "DDDD DD MMMM YYYY" => "Thursday 22 August 2024"

## Themes

### Fade (the default)
Soft gradient background for the clock and image metadata.

![Kiosk theme fade](/assets/theme-fade.jpeg)

### Solid
Solid background for the clock and image metadata.

![Kiosk theme solid](/assets/theme-solid.jpeg)

------

## Layouts

> [!NOTE]
> Throughout all layouts: Kiosk attempts to determine the orientation of each image. However, if an image lacks EXIF data,
> it may be displayed in an incorrect orientation (e.g., a portrait image shown in landscape format).

The following layout options determine how images are displayed:

### Single (the default)
This is the standard layout that displays one image at a time, regardless of orientation.
It works with both portrait and landscape images.

![Kiosk theme fade](/assets/theme-fade.jpeg)

### Portrait
This layout displays one portrait-oriented image at a time.

### Landscape
This layout displays one landscape-oriented image at a time.

### Splitview
When a portrait image is fetched, Kiosk automatically retrieves a second portrait image\* and displays them side by side vertically. Landscape and square images are displayed individually.

\* If Kiosk is unable to retrieve a second unique image, the first image will be displayed individually.

![Kiosk layout splitview](/assets/layout-splitview.jpg)

### Splitview landscape
When a landscape image is fetched, Kiosk automatically retrieves a second landscape image\* and displays them stacked horizontally. portrait and square images are displayed individually.

\* If Kiosk is unable to retrieve a second unique image, the first image will be displayed individually.

------

## Sleep mode

> [!TIP]
> You can add `disable_sleep=true` to your URL queries to bypass sleepmode.

### Enabling Sleep Mode:
Setting both `sleep_start` and `sleep_end` using the 24 hour format will enable sleep mode.

### During Sleep Mode:
Kiosk will display a black screen and can optionally shows a faint clock if `show_time` or `show_date` and enabled.

### Examples
- Setting `sleep_start=22` and `sleep_end=7` will enable sleep mode from 22:00 (10pm) to 07:00 (7am).
- Setting `sleep_start=1332` and `sleep_end=1508` will enable sleep mode from 13:32 (1:32pm) to 15:08 (3:08pm).

------

## Custom CSS
> [!NOTE]
> Custom CSS is applied after all other styles, allowing you to override any default styles.

> [!WARNING]
> Be cautious when using custom CSS, as it may interfere with the normal functioning of Kiosk if not implemented correctly.
> While I'm happy to help with general Kiosk issues, I may not be able to provide specific support for problems related to custom CSS implementations.

Custom CSS allows you to further customize Kiosk's appearance beyond the built-in themes and settings.

To use custom CSS:
1. Create a file named `custom.css` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. Add your custom CSS rules to this file.
3. Mount the `custom.css` file in your container by adding the following line to the `volumes` section of your `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./config:/config
  - ./custom.css:/custom.css
```
4. Restart your Kiosk container for the changes to take effect.

> [!TIP]
> Ensure that the path to your `custom.css` file is relative to your `docker-compose.yml` file.

The custom CSS will apply to all devices connected to Kiosk by default.

To disable custom CSS for a specific device, add `custom_css=false` to the URL parameters e.g. `http://{URL}?custom_css=false`

### Custom CSS class

To add a class to the `<body>` tag add `custom_css_class=CUSTOM-CLASS` to the URL parameters e.g. `http://{URL}?custom_css_class=foo`

This enables you to target specific devices in your CSS.

e.g.

```CSS
/* applied to all */
#clock,
#weather,
.image--metadata {
    padding: 4rem;
}

/* applied to devices with `custom_css_class=foo` */
.foo #clock,
.foo #weather,
.image--metadata {
    padding: 2rem;
}
```

## Weather

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature can only be configured using a `config.yaml` file.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the weather feature, you’ll need an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org).

> [!TIP]
> OpenWeatherMap limits API usage to 60 calls per hour.
> Since the kiosk refreshes weather data every 10 minutes, you can monitor up to 6 locations with a single API key.

### Setting Up Weather Locations

You can configure multiple locations in the `config.yaml` file, and choose which one to display using the URL query `weather=NAME`.

### Weather Location Configuration Options:

> [!TIP]
> If you would prefer to use the location name from OpenWeatherMap's API, add "-api" to the end of the name.
> e.g. `name: london-api`

| **Value**   | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| name        | The location’s display name (used in the URL query). |
| lat         | Latitude of the location. |
| lon         | Longitude of the location. |
| api         | OpenWeatherMap API key. |
| unit        | Units of measurement (`standard`, `metric`, or `imperial`). |
| lang        | Language code for weather descriptions (see the full list [here](https://openweathermap.org/current#multi)). |
| default     | Set this location as the default (when no location is specified) |

### Example Configuration

Here’s an example of how to add London, London using OpenWeatherMap's name and New York to the config.yaml file. These locations would be selectable via the URL, like this:
http://{URL}?weather=london or http://{URL}?weather=new-york.

```yaml
 weather:
  - name: london
    lat: 51.5285262
    lon: -0.2663999
    api: API_KEY
    unit: metric
    lang: en
    default: true

  - name: london-api
    lat: 51.5285262
    lon: -0.2663999
    api: API_KEY
    unit: metric
    lang: en
    default: true

  - name: new-york
    lat: 40.6973709
    lon: -74.1444838
    api: API_KEY
    unit: imperial
    lang: en
```

## Navigation Controls

You can interact with Kiosk in three ways: touch, mouse, or keyboard.

### Touch & Click Zones

Kiosk's display is divided into interactive zones:

![Interaction zones](/assets/click-zones.jpg)

1. Left Side: Previous image(s)
2. Center top: Pause/Play and Toggle Menu
3. Right Side: Next image(s)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key           | Action                                                   |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| _ Spacebar    | Play/Pause and Toggle Menu                               |
| → Right Arrow | Next Image(s)                                            |
| ← Left Arrow  | Previous Image(s)                                        |

```

------

## Redirects

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature can only be configured using a `config.yaml` file.

Redirects provide a simple way to map short, memorable paths to longer URLs.
It's particularly useful for creating friendly URLs that redirect to more
complex endpoints with query parameters.

## How they Work

### Configuration
Redirects are defined in the `config.yaml` file under the `kiosk.redirects` section:

Each redirect consists of:
- `name`: The short path that users will use
- `url`: The destination URL where users will be redirected to
- `type`: Optional field that controls URL behavior:
  - `internal`: The default behavior that keeps the URL unchanged during redirection (useful for maintaining browser history)
  - `external`: Allows URL changes during redirection (default if omitted)

### Examples

```yaml
kiosk:
  redirects:
    - name: london
      url: /?weather=london
      type: external

    - name: sheffield
      url: /?weather=sheffield

    - name: our-wedding
      url: /?weather=london&album=51be319b-55ea-40b0-83b7-27ac0a0d84a3
      type: external

```

| Source URL                  | Redirects to                                                |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| http://{URL}/london         | /?weather=london                                            |
| http://{URL}/sheffield      | http://{URL}/sheffield                                      |
| http://{URL}/our-wedding    | /?weather=london&album=51be319b-55ea-40b0-83b7-27ac0a0d84a3 |

------

## PWA

> [!NOTE]
> IOS does not allow PWA's to prevent the screen from going to sleep.
> A work around is to lauch Kiosk then enable the [guided access](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph7fad0d10/ios) feature.

### IOS
1. Open Safari and navigate to Kiosk.
2. Tap on the share icon in Safari's navigation bar.
3. Scroll till you see "Add to Home Screen" and tap it.
4. Tap on the newly added Kiosk icon on your home screen!

------

## Webhooks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature can only be configured using a `config.yaml` file.

> [!TIP]
> To include the `clientName` in your webhook payload, append `client=YOUR_CLIENT_NAME` to your URL parameters.

Kiosk can notify external services about certain events using webhooks. When enabled, Kiosk will send HTTP POST requests to your specified webhook URL(s) when these events occur.

### Enabling Webhooks

Add webhook configuration to your `config.yaml`:

> [!TIP]
> You can have multiple webhooks for different urls and events.

```yaml
webhooks:
  - url: "https://your-webhook-endpoint.com"
    event: asset.new
    secret: "my_webhook_secret" # Optional secret for securing webhooks
```

When a secret is provided, Kiosk will generate a SHA-256 HMAC signature using the webhook payload and include it in the `X-Kiosk-Signature-256` header.
This allows you to verify that webhook request came from your Kiosk instance, following the same validation pattern as [GitHub webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/validating-webhook-deliveries).

To validate webhooks on your server, you should:
1. Get the signature from the `X-Kiosk-Signature-256` header
2. Generate a HMAC hex digest using your secret and the raw request body
3. Compare the signatures using a constant-time comparison function

### Available Events

| Event                              | Description                                                                         |

## Home Assistant

> [!NOTE]
> These examples are community Kiosk implementations.
> I am unable to provide support for Home Assistant via issues.

While I did not create Kiosk with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) in mind. I thought it would be useful to add Kiosk implementations I have come across.

### Using Kiosk to add a slideshow in Home Assistant.

1. Open up the dahsboard you want to add the slideshow to in edit mode.
2. Hit "add card" and search "webpage".
3. Enter the your Immich Kiosk url in the URL field e.g. `http://192.168.0.123:3000`
4. If you want to have some specific settings for the slideshow you can add them to the *[URL](#changing-settings-via-url)

\* I would suggest disabling all the UI i.e. `http://192.168.0.123:3000?disable_ui=true`

### Using Kiosk to set Immich images as Home Assistant dashboard background
1. Navigate to the dashboard with the view you wish to add the image background to.
2. Enter edit mode and click the ✏ next to the view you want to add the image to.
3. Select the "background" tab and toggle on "Local path or web URL" and enter your url* with path /image e.g. http://192.168.0.123:3000/image.

\* If you want to specify an album or a person you can also add that to the url e.g. http://192.168.0.123:3000/image?album=ALBUM_ID

### Using Immich Kiosk as an image source for Wallpanel in Home Assistant:

> [!TIP]
> The new version of wallpanel doesn't seem to grab new images if the url is not dynamic.

## FAQ

![no-wifi icon](/assets/offline.svg)\
**Q: What is the no wifi icon?**\
**A**: This icon shows when the front end can't connect to the back end.

![flush cache icon](/assets/flush-cache.svg)\
**Q: What is this icon in the menu?**\
**A**: Clicking this icon tells Kiosk to delete all cached data and refresh the current device.

**Q: Can I use this to set Immich images as my Home Assistant dashboard background?**\
**A**: Yes! Just navigate to the dashboard with the view you wish to add the image background to.
Enter edit mode and click the ✏ next to the view you want to add the image to.
Then select the "background" tab and toggle on "Local path or web URL" and enter your url with path `/image` e.g. `http://192.168.0.123:3000/image`.
If you want to specify an album or a person you can also add that to the url e.g. `http://192.168.0.123:3000/image?album=ALBUM_ID`

**Q: Do I need to a docker service for each client?**\
**A**: You only need one docker service (or binary running) that your devices(s) will connect to.

**Q: Do I have to use port 3000?**\
**A**: Nope. Just change the host port in your docker compose file i.e. `- 3000:3000` to `- PORT_YOU_WANT:3000`


**Q: How do I set/use a password?**\
**A**: 👇

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is meant for edgecase scenarios and offers very little in terms of protection.
> If you are aiming to expose Kiosk beyond your local network, please investigate more secure alternatives.

via config.yaml file
```yaml
kiosk:
  password: 12345
```

via ENV in your docker-compose file
```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_PASSWORD: "12345"
```


Then to access Kiosk you MUST add the password param in your URL e.g. http://{URL}?password=12345
